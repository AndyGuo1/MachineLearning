### 神经网络算法的起源
![神经网络算法的起源](amWiki/images/001/04-Week4/1-Neural Networks Representation/8-神经网络算法的起源.jpg)  
神经网络是一种很古老的算法 它最初产生的目的是制造能模拟大脑的机器 在这门课中 我将向你们介绍神经网络 因为它能很好地解决 不同的机器学习问题 而不只因为它们在逻辑上行得通 在本节课的视频中 告诉你们一些神经网络的背景知识 由此我们能知道可以用它们来做什么 不管是将其应用到 现代的机器学习问题上 还是应用到 那些你可能会 感兴趣的问题中 也许 这一伟大的人工智能梦想在未来 能制造出真正的智能机器 另外 我们还将讲解神经网络是怎么涉及这些问题的神经网络产生的原因 是人们想尝试设计出 模仿大脑的算法 从某种意义上说如果我们 想要建立学习系统 那为什么不去模仿 我们所认识的 最神奇的学习机器—— 人类的大脑呢 神经网络逐渐兴起于 二十世纪八九十年代 应用得非常广泛 但由于各种原因 在90年代的后期应用减少了 但是最近 神经网络 又东山再起了 其中一个原因是 神经网络 是计算量有些 偏大的算法 然而 大概由于近些年 计算机的运行速度变快 才足以真正运行起大规模的 神经网络 正是由于这个原因 和其他一些我们后面会讨论到的 技术因素 如今的神经网络 对于许多应用来说是最先进的技术 当你想模拟大脑时 是指想制造出与人类大脑 作用效果相同的机器 对吧？ 大脑可以学会去 以看而不是听的方式处理图像 学会处理我们的触觉 我们能学习数学  学着做微积分 而且大脑能处理 各种不同的令人惊奇的事情 似乎如果你想要 模仿它 你得写很多不同的 软件来模拟所有 大脑告诉我们的这些 五花八门的奇妙的事情 不过能不能假设 大脑做所有这些 不同事情的方法 不需要用上千个不同的程序去实现 相反的 大脑处理的方法 只需要 一个单一的学习算法就可以了？

尽管这只是一个假设 不过让我和你分享 一些这方面的证据 大脑的这一部分 这一小片红色区域 是你的听觉皮层 你现在正在理解我的话 这靠的是耳朵 耳朵接收到声音信号 并把声音信号传递给你的 听觉皮层 正因如此 你才能明白我的话 神经系统科学家做了 下面这个有趣的实验 把耳朵到 听觉皮层的神经切断 在这种情况下 将其重新接到一个动物的大脑上 这样从眼睛到 视神经的信号最终将传到听觉皮层 如果这样做了 那么结果表明 听觉皮层将会学会“看” 这里“看”代表了 我们所知道的每层含义 所以 如果你对动物这样做 那么动物就可以完成视觉辨别任务 它们可以 看图像 并根据图像 做出适当的决定 它们正是通过 脑组织中的这个部分完成的

来看另一个例子 这块红色的脑组织是你的躯体感觉皮层 这是你用来处理触觉的 如果你做一个和刚才类似的重接实验 那么躯体感觉皮层也能学会”看“ 这个实验和其它一些 类似的实验 被称为神经重接实验
### 神经重接实验_小结
从这个意义上说 如果 人体有同一块 脑组织可以处理光、 声或触觉信号 那么也许存在一种学习算法 可以同时处理 视觉、听觉和触觉 而不是需要 运行上千个不同的程序 或者上千个不同的算法来做这些 大脑所完成的 成千上万的美好事情 也许我们需要做的就是找出 一些近似的或 实际的大脑学习算法 然后实现它 大脑通过自学掌握如何 处理这些不同类型的数据 在很大的程度上 可以猜想如果我们 把几乎任何一种传感器 接入到大脑的 几乎任何一个部位的话 大脑就会学会处理它

### Example for Non-linear Classification
![Example for Non-linear Classification](amWiki/images/001/04-Week4/1-Neural Networks Representation/1-非线性分类举例.jpg)  
Neural Networks are a pretty old algorithm that was originally motivated by the goal of having machines that can mimic the brain. Now in this class, of course I'm teaching Neural Networks to you because they work really well for different machine learning problems and not, certainly not because they're logically motivated.In this video, I'd like to give you some of the background on Neural Networks. So that we can get a sense of what we can expect them to do. Both in the sense of applying them to modern day machinery problems, as well as for those of you that might be interested in maybe the big AI dream of someday building truly intelligent machines.Also, how Neural Networks might pertain to that.The origins of Neural Networks was as algorithms that try to mimic the brain and those a sense that if we want to build learning systems while why not mimic perhaps the most amazing learning machine we know about, which is perhaps the brain. Neural Networks came to be very widely used throughout the 1980's and 1990's and for various reasons as popularity diminished in the late 90's. But more recently, Neural Networks have had a major recent resurgence.One of the reasons for this resurgence is that Neural Networks are computationally some what more expensive algorithm and so, it was only, you know, maybe somewhat more recently that computers became fast enough to really run large scale Neural Networks and because of that as well as a few other technical reasons which we'll talk about later, modern Neural Networks today are the state of the art technique for many applications.So, when you think about mimicking the brain while one of the human brain does tell me same things, right? The brain can learn to see process images than to hear, learn to process our sense of touch. We can, you know, learn to do math, learn to do calculus, and the brain does so many different and amazing things. It seems like if you want to mimic the brain it seems like you have to write lots of different pieces of software to mimic all of these different fascinating, amazing things that the brain tell us, but does is this fascinating hypothesis that the way the brain does all of these different things is not worth like a thousand different programs, but instead, the way the brain does it is worth just a single learning algorithm.
### Neuro-rewiring experiments_Let auditory cortex learn to see
![Neuro-rewiring experiments_Let auditory cortex learn to see](amWiki/images/001/04-Week4/1-Neural Networks Representation/9-神经重接实验_听觉转换为视觉.jpg)
This is just a hypothesis but let me share with you some of the evidence for this. This part of the brain, that little red part of the brain, is your auditory cortex and the way you're understanding my voice now is your ear is taking the sound signal and routing the sound signal to your auditory cortex and that's what's allowing you to understand my words.
Neuroscientists have done the following fascinating experiments where you cut the wire from the ears to the auditory cortex and you re-wire,in this case an animal's brain, so that the signal from the eyes to the optic nerve eventually gets routed to the auditory cortex.If you do this it turns out, the auditory cortex will learn to see. And this is in every single sense of the word see as we know it. So, if you do this to the animals, the animals can perform visual discrimination task and as they can look at images and make appropriate decisions based on the images and they're doing it with that piece of brain tissue.
### Neuro-rewiring experiments_Let somatosensory cortex learn to see
![Neuro-rewiring experiments_Let somatosensory cortex learn to see](amWiki/images/001/04-Week4/1-Neural Networks Representation/10-神经重接实验_触觉转换为视觉.jpg)
Here's another example.That red piece of brain tissue is your somatosensory cortex. That's how you process your sense of touch. If you do a similar re-wiring process then the somatosensory cortex will learn to see. Because of this and other similar experiments, these are called neuro-rewiring experiments.
### Summary_Neuro-rewiring experiments
There's this sense that if the same piece of physical brain tissue can process sight or sound or touch then maybe there is one learning algorithm that can process sight or sound or touch. And instead of needing to implement a thousand different programs or a thousand different algorithms to do, you know, the thousand wonderful things that the brain does, maybe what we need to do is figure out some approximation or to whatever the brain's learning algorithm is and implement that and that the brain learned by itself how to process these different types of data.To a surprisingly large extent, it seems as if we can plug in almost any sensor to almost any part of the brain and so, within the reason, the brain will learn to deal with it.
### Sensor representation in the brain
![Sensor representation in the brain](amWiki/images/001/04-Week4/1-Neural Networks Representation/11-传感器在大脑中表现.jpg)
Here are a few more examples. On the upper left is an example of learning to see with your tongue. The way it works is--this is actually a system called BrainPort undergoing FDA trials now to help blind people see--but the way it works is, you strap a grayscale camera to your forehead, facing forward, that takes the low resolution grayscale image of what's in front of you and you then run a wire to an array of electrodes that you place on your tongue so that each pixel gets mapped to a location on your tongue where maybe a high voltage corresponds to a dark pixel and a low voltage corresponds to a bright pixel and, even as it does today, with this sort of system you and I will be able to learn to see, you know, in tens of minutes with our tongues. Here's a second example of human echo location or human sonar.So there are two ways you can do this. You can either snap your fingers,or click your tongue. I can't do that very well. But there are blind people today that are actually being trained in schools to do this and learn to interpret the pattern of sounds bouncing off your environment - that's sonar. So, if after you search on YouTube, there are actually videos of this amazing kid who tragically because of cancer had his eyeballs removed, so this is a kid with no eyeballs. But by snapping his fingers, he can walk around and never hit anything. He can ride a skateboard. He can shoot a basketball into a hoop and this is a kid with no eyeballs.Third example is the Haptic Belt where if you have a strap around your waist, ring up buzzers and always have the northmost one buzzing. You can give a human a direction sense similar to maybe how birds can, you know, sense where north is. And, some of the bizarre example, but if you plug a third eye into a frog, the frog will learn to use that eye as well.So, it's pretty amazing to what extent is as if you can plug in almost any sensor to the brain and the brain's learning algorithm will just figure out how to learn from that data and deal with that data.And there's a sense that if we can figure out what the brain's learning algorithm is, and, you know, implement it or implement some approximation to that algorithm on a computer, maybe that would be our best shot at, you know, making real progress towards the AI, the artificial intelligence dream of someday building truly intelligent machines.Now, of course, I'm not teaching Neural Networks, you know, just because they might give us a window into this far-off AI dream, even though I'm personally, that's one of the things that I personally work on in my research life. But the main reason I'm teaching Neural Networks in this class is because it's actually a very effective state of the art technique for modern day machine learning applications. So, in the next few videos, we'll start diving into the technical details of Neural Networks so that you can apply them to modern-day machine learning applications and get them to work well on problems. But for me, you know, one of the reasons the excite me is that maybe they give us this window into what we might do if we're also thinking of what algorithms might someday be able to learn in a manner similar to humankind.
