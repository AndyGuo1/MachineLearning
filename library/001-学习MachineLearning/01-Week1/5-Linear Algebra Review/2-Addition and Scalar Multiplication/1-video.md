在这段视频中 我们要讲 我们将讨论矩阵的加法和减法运算 以及如何进行 数和矩阵的乘法 也就是标量乘法
### 矩阵的加法
![矩阵加法](amWiki/images/001/01-Week1/5-Linear Algebra Review/6-矩阵加法.jpg)
让我们从下面这个例子开始 假设有这样两个矩阵 如果想对它们做求和运算 应该怎么做呢？ 或者说 矩阵的加法到底是如何进行的？ 答案是 如果你想将两个矩阵相加 你只需要将这两个矩阵的 每一个元素都逐个相加 因此 两个矩阵相加 所得到的结果 就是一个新的矩阵 它的第一个元素 是1和4相加的结果 因此我们得到5 接下来是第二个元素 用2和2相加 因此得到4 然后是3加0得到3 以此类推 这里我用不同颜色区别一下 接下来右边这一列元素 就是0.5 10和2这里大家不难发现 只有相同维度的两个矩阵才能相加 对于这个例子而言 一個3 x 2的矩陣 也就是说矩阵的行数为3 列数是2 因此是3行2列 第二个矩阵 也是一个3行2列的矩阵 因此这两个矩阵相加的结果 也是一个3行2列的矩阵 所以你只能将相同维度的矩阵 进行相加运算 同时 所得到的结果 将会是一个新的矩阵 这个矩阵与相加的两个矩阵维度相同 反过来 如果你想将这样两个矩阵相加 这是一个3行2列的矩阵 行数为3 列数为2 而这一个是2行2列的矩阵 那么由于这两个矩阵 维度是不相同的 这就出现错误了 所以我们不能将它们相加 也就是说 这两个矩阵的和是没有意义的 这就是矩阵的加法运算
### 矩阵和标量的乘法

接下来 我们讨论矩阵和标量的乘法运算 这里所说的标量 可能是一个复杂的结构 或者只是一个简单的数字 或者说实数 标量在这里指的就是实数 如果我们用数字3来和这个矩阵相乘 那么结果是显而易见的 你只需要将矩阵中的所有元素 都和3相乘 每一个都逐一与3相乘 因此 1和3相乘 结果是3 2和3相乘 结果是6 最后3乘以3得9 我再换一下颜色 0乘以3得0 3乘以5得15 最后3乘以1得3 这样得到的这个矩阵 就是左边这个矩阵和3相乘的结果 我们再次注意到 这是一个3行2列的矩阵 得到的结果矩阵 维度也是相同的 也就是说这两个矩阵 都是3行2列 这也是3行2列 另外 你也可以写成另一种方式 这里是3和这个矩阵相乘 你也可以把这个矩阵写在前面 1 0 2 5 3 1 把左边这个矩阵照抄过来 我们也可以用这个矩阵乘以3 也就是说 3乘以这个矩阵 和这个矩阵乘以3 结果都是一回事 都是中间的这个矩阵 你也可以用矩阵除以一个数 那么 我们可以看到 用这个矩阵除以4 实际上就是 用四分之一 来和这个矩阵相乘 4 0 6 3 不难发现 相乘的结果是 1/4和4相乘为1 1/4和0相乘得0 1/4乘以6 结果是3/2 6/4也就是3/2 最后1/4乘以3得3/4 这样我们就得到了 这个矩阵除以4的结果 结果就是是右边这个矩阵
### 矩阵加法和标量乘法综合运算
![矩阵加法和标量乘法综合运算](amWiki/images/001/01-Week1/5-Linear Algebra Review/8-矩阵加法和标量乘法综合运算.jpg)
最后 我们来看一个稍微复杂一点的例子 我们可以把所有这些运算结合起来 在这个运算中 需要用3来乘以这个向量 然后加上一个向量 再减去另一个向量除以3的结果 让我们先来整理一下这几项运算 首先第一个运算 很明显这是标量乘法的例子 因为这里是用3来乘以一个矩阵 然后这一项 很显然这是另一个标量乘法 或者可以叫标量除法 其实也就是1/3乘以这个矩阵 因此 如果我们先考虑这两项运算 那么我们将得到的是 我们看一下 3乘以这个矩阵 结果是3 12 6 然后和中间的矩阵相加 也就是0 0 5 最后再减去1 0 2/3 同样地 为了便于理解 我们再来梳理一下这几项 这里的这个加号 表明这是一个矩阵加法 对吧？ 当然这里是向量 别忘了 向量是特殊的矩阵 对吧？ 或者你也可以称之为 向量加法运算 同样 这里的减号表明 这是一个矩阵减法运算 但由于这是一个n行1列的矩阵 实际上是3行1列 因此这个矩阵 实际上是也一个向量 一个列向量 因此也可以把它称作向量的减法运算 明白了吗 最后再整理一下 最终的结果依然是一个向量 向量的第一个元素 是3+0-1 就是3-1 也就是2 第二个元素是12+0-0 也就是12 最后第三个元素 6+5-(2/3) 也就是11-(2/3) 结果是10又三分之一 关闭右括号 我们得到了最终的结果 这是一个3行1列的矩阵 或者也可以说是 一个维度为3的向量 这就是这个运算式的计算结果 所以 你学会了矩阵或向量的加减运算 以及矩阵或向量跟标量 或者说实数 的乘法运算 到目前为止 我只介绍了如何进行 矩阵或向量与数的乘法运算 在下一讲中 我们将讨论一个更有趣的话题 那就是如何进行 两个矩阵的乘法运算

### Matrix Addition
![Matrix Addition](amWiki/images/001/01-Week1/5-Linear Algebra Review/6-矩阵加法.jpg)
In this video we'll talk about matrix addition and subtraction, as well as how to multiply a matrix by a number, also called Scalar Multiplication. Let's start an example. Given two matrices like these, let's say I want to add them together. How do I do that? And so, what does addition of matrices mean? It turns out that if you want to add two matrices, what you do is you just add up the elements of these matrices one at a time. So, my result of adding two matrices is going to be itself another matrix and the first element again just by taking one and four and multiplying them and adding them together, so I get five. The second element I get by taking two and two and adding them, so I get four; three plus three plus zero is three, and so on. I'm going to stop changing colors, I guess. And, on the right is open five, ten and two.And it turns out you can add only two matrices that are of the same dimensions. So this example is a three by two matrix,because this has 3 rows and 2 columns, so it's 3 by 2. This is also a 3 by 2 matrix, and the result of adding these two matrices is a 3 by 2 matrix again. So you can only add matrices of the same dimension, and the result will be another matrix that's of the same dimension as the ones you just added.Where as in contrast, if you were to take these two matrices, so this one is a 3 by 2 matrix, okay, 3 rows, 2 columns. This here is a 2 by 2 matrix. And because these two matrices are not of the same dimension, you know, this is an error, so you cannot add these two matrices and, you know, their sum is not well-defined. So that's matrix addition.
### Multiply Matrices by a scalar number
![ Multiply Matrices by a scalar number](amWiki/images/001/01-Week1/5-Linear Algebra Review/7-矩阵和标量乘法.jpg)
Next, let's talk about multiplying matrices by a scalar number. And the scalar is just a, maybe a overly fancy term for, you know, a number or a real number. Alright, this means real number. So let's take the number 3 and multiply it by this matrix. And if you do that, the result is pretty much what you'll expect. You just take your elements of the matrix and multiply them by 3, one at a time. So, you know, one times three is three. What, two times three is six, 3 times 3 is 9, and let's see, I'm going to stop changing colors again. Zero times 3 is zero. Three times 5 is 15, and 3 times 1 is three. And so this matrix is the result of multiplying that matrix on the left by 3. And you notice, again, this is a 3 by 2 matrix and the result is a matrix of the same dimension. This is a 3 by 2, both of these are 3 by 2 dimensional matrices. And by the way, you can write multiplication, you know, either way. So, I have three times this matrix. I could also have written this matrix and 0, 2, 5, 3, 1, right. I just copied this matrix over to the right. I can also take this matrix and multiply this by three. So whether it's you know, 3 times the matrix or the matrix times three is the same thing and this thing here in the middle is the result. You can also take a matrix and divide it by a number. So, turns out taking this matrix and dividing it by four, this is actually the same as taking the number one quarter, and multiplying it by this matrix. 4, 0, 6, 3 and so, you can figure the answer, the result of this product is, one quarter times four is one, one quarter times zero is zero. One quarter times six is, what, three halves, about six over four is three halves, and one quarter times three is three quarters. And so that's the results of computing this matrix divided by four. Vectors give you the result.
### Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication Combine
![Matrix Addition and Scalar Multiplication Combine](amWiki/images/001/01-Week1/5-Linear Algebra Review/8-矩阵加法和标量乘法综合运算.jpg)
Finally, for a slightly more complicated example, you can also take these operations and combine them together. So in this calculation, I have three times a vector plus a vector minus another vector divided by three. So just make sure we know where these are, right. This multiplication. This is an example of scalar multiplication because I am taking three and multiplying it. And this is, you know, another scalar multiplication. Or more like scalar division, I guess. It really just means one zero times this. And so if we evaluate these two operations first, then what we get is this thing is equal to, let's see, so three times that vector is three, twelve, six, plus my vector in the middle which is a 005 minus one, zero, two-thirds, right? And again, just to make sure we understand what is going on here, this plus symbol, that is matrix addition, right? I really, since these are vectors, remember, vectors are special cases of matrices, right? This, you can also call this vector addition This minus sign here, this is again a matrix subtraction, but because this is an n by 1, really a three by one matrix, that this is actually a vector, so this is also vector, this column. We call this matrix a vector subtraction, as well. OK? And finally to wrap this up. This therefore gives me a vector, whose first element is going to be 3+0-1, so that's 3-1, which is 2. The second element is 12+0-0, which is 12. And the third element of this is, what, 6+5-(2/3), which is 11-(2/3), so that's 10 and one-third and see, you close this square bracket. And so this gives me a 3 by 1 matrix, which is also just called a 3 dimensional vector, which is the outcome of this calculation over here. So that's how you add and subtract matrices and vectors and multiply them by scalars or by row numbers. So far I have only talked about how to multiply matrices and vectors by scalars, by row numbers. In the next video we will talk about a much more interesting step, of taking 2 matrices and multiplying 2 matrices together.
