矩阵乘法运算非常实用 因为你可以通过矩阵乘法 将大量运算打包到 一次矩阵的乘法运算中但是怎样使用这个方法你要提起注意 在这个视频中 我想 介绍一些矩阵乘法的特性 运算时 如果仅仅使用实数 或者说是标量 乘法是可以交换的我的意思是说 如果你用3乘以5 那么这个运算等同于 5乘以3 这个乘法运算中两个量的顺序不重要 这就是实数乘法 的交换律 通过这个定律 你能够颠倒 乘法运算中变量的顺序 但是这不能应用在矩阵乘法中 所以 具体来讲 如果变量A和 B是矩阵 通常情况下 A乘以B 不等于B乘以A 因此应该注意到这一点 随意颠倒矩阵乘法的顺序是不可行的 因此 我们说 矩阵乘法 是不可交换的 这样说起来比较难懂 举一个具体的例子 有两个矩阵 矩阵[1 1; 0 0] 乘以[0 0; 2 0] 如果你将 这两个矩阵相乘 你会得到右边的结果 现在 让我们左右交换这两个矩阵的顺序 我们对这两个 矩阵 仅仅交换了一下位置 结果呢 你对这两个矩阵相乘的时候 你在右边得出了 第二种答案 你看 很明显 这个矩阵不同于 之前的结果 所以 事实上 在通常情况下 如果你 做一个矩阵运算 比如A乘以B 如果 A是一个m×n的矩阵 B是一个n×m的矩阵 以此举例 这样 结果表明 矩阵A乘以B 会得到 一个m×m 的矩阵 当情况是 矩阵 B×A 的时候会得到一个n×n的矩阵 所以 结果中即使是矩阵的维度都不相同 好吧 所以矩阵A乘以B和 B乘以A可能得到不相同的维度 在左边的例子中 我有使用的都是2×2的矩阵 这样的维度是相同的 但是通常情况 交换矩阵顺序 会改变结果维度 明白? 矩阵乘法是不服从交换律的

这是我接下来要讲的 所以当谈到实数 或标量的时候 请看 我用3×5×2. 我也可以先用5 乘以2 然后用3乘以10 再或者 我可以将 3乘以5 我可以这样计算 再用15乘以2 这两种算法得到了相同的答案 对吧？ 这两个方法 都等于30 所以 无论 先用5乘以2 或者 先用3乘以5 都是因为 3乘以5再乘以2 都等于3乘以 5再乘以2 这就是 所谓的 数乘的结合律 事实证明 矩阵乘法也符合结合律 因此 具体来说 做三个矩阵的乘积 矩阵A乘以矩阵B再乘以 矩阵C.然后我就可以 A乘以 B×C 或者可以计算 A×B 再乘以C 这将给出相同的答案 我不做这个运算的证明 但是 我想你可以把我的话记下来 对吧? 就行了 让我们来看看 第一种情况 我是说 如果你要计算 A×B×C 你可以通过 先计算B矩阵和C矩阵的积 这样D等于B×C 这时候计算A×D 事实上这就是 A×B×C 或者是 第二种情况下 你可以这样计算 设定E等于A×B 然后计算 ExC 这就等同于 对吧? 结果表明 这两种选择 都能保证给出相同的答案 所以说矩阵乘法能够服从结合律 好吧？ 同时不用担心术语 结合律和交换律 因为在这个课程后面的讲解中

### Matrix Multiplication is not commutative

Matrix multiplication is really useful, since you can pack a lot of computation into just one matrix multiplication operation. But you should be careful of how you use them. In this video, I wanna tell you about a few properties of matrix multiplication.When working with just real numbers or when working with scalars, multiplication is commutative. And what I mean by that is that if you take 3 times 5, that is equal to 5 times 3. And the ordering of this multiplication doesn't matter. And this is called the commutative property of multiplication of real numbers. It turns out this property, they can reverse the order in which you multiply things. This is not true for matrix multiplication. So concretely, if A and B are matrices. Then in general, A times B is not equal to B times A. So, just be careful of that. Its not okay to arbitrarily reverse the order in which you multiply matrices. Matrix multiplication in not commutative, is the fancy way of saying it. As a concrete example, here are two matrices. This matrix 1 1 0 0 times 0 0 2 0 and if you multiply these two matrices you get this result on the right. Now let's swap around the order of these two matrices. So I'm gonna take this two matrices and just reverse them. It turns out if you multiply these two matrices, you get the second answer on the right. And well clearly, right, these two matrices are not equal to each other.So, in fact, in general if you have a matrix operation like A times B, if A is an m by n matrix, and B is an n by m matrix, just as an example. Then, it turns out that the matrix A times B,right, is going to be an m by m matrix. Whereas the matrix B times A is going to be an n by n matrix. So the dimensions don't even match, right? So if A x B and B x A may not even be the same dimension. In the example on the left, I have all two by two matrices. So the dimensions were the same, but in general, reversing the order of the matrices can even change the dimension of the outcome. So, matrix multiplication is not commutative.

Here's the next property I want to talk about. So, when talking about real numbers or scalars, let's say I have 3 x 5 x 2. I can either multiply 5 x 2 first. Then I can compute this as 3 x 10. Or, I can multiply 3 x 5 first, and I can compute this as 15 x 2. And both of these give you the same answer, right? Both of these is equal to 30. So it doesn't matter whether I multiply 5 x 2 first or whether I multiply 3 x 5 first, because sort of, well, 3 x (5 x 2) = (3 x 5) x 2. And this is called the associative property of real number multiplication. It turns out that matrix multiplication is associative. So concretely, let's say I have a product of three matrices A x B x C. Then, I can compute this either as A x (B x C) or I can computer this as (A x B) x C, and these will actually give me the same answer. I'm not gonna prove this but you can just take my word for it I guess. So just be clear, what I mean by these two cases. Let's look at the first one, right. This first case. What I mean by that is if you actually wanna compute A x B x C. What you can do is you can first compute B x C. So that D = B x C then compute A x D. And so this here is really computing A x B x C. Or, for this second case, you can compute this as, you can set E = A x B, then compute E times C. And this is then the same as A x B x C, and it turns out that both of these options will give you this guarantee to give you the same answer. And so we say that matrix multiplication thus enjoy the associative property. Okay? And don't worry about the terminology associative and commutative. That's what it's called, but I'm not really going to use this terminology later in this class, so don't worry about memorizing those terms.

Finally, I want to tell you about the Identity Matrix, which is a special matrix. So let's again make the analogy to what we know of real numbers. When dealing with real numbers or scalar numbers, the number 1, you can think of it as the identity of multiplication. And what I mean by that is that for any number z, 1 x z = z x 1. And that's just equal to the number z for any real number z.So 1 is the identity operation and so it satisfies this equation. So it turns out, that this in the space of matrices there's an identity matrix as well and it's usually denoted I or sometimes we write it as I of n x n if we want to make it explicit to dimensions. So I subscript n x n is the n x n identity matrix. And so that's a different identity matrix for each dimension n. And here are few examples. Here's the 2 x 2 identity matrix, here's the 3 x 3 identity matrix, here's the 4 x 4 matrix. So the identity matrix has the property that it has ones along the diagonals.All right, and so on. And 0 everywhere else. And so, by the way, the 1 x 1 identity matrix is just a number 1, and so the 1 x 1 matrix with just 1 in it. So it's not a very interesting identity matrix. And informally, when I or others are being sloppy, very often we'll write the identity matrices in fine notation. We'll draw square brackets, just write one one one dot dot dot dot one, and then we'll maybe somewhat sloppily write a bunch of zeros there. And these zeroes on the, this big zero and this big zero, that's meant to denote that this matrix is zero everywhere except for the diagonal. So this is just how I might swap you the right D identity matrix. And it turns out that the identity matrix has its property that for any matrix A, A times identity equals I times A equals A so that's a lot like this equation that we have up here. Right? So 1 times z equals z times 1 equals z itself. So I times A equals A times I equals A.Just to make sure we have the dimensions right. So if A is an m by n matrix, then this identity matrix here, that's an n by n identity matrix.And if is and by then, then this identity matrix, right? For matrix multiplication to make sense, that has to be an m by m matrix. Because this m has the match up that m, and in either case, the outcome of this process is you get back the matrix A which is m by n.So whenever we write the identity matrix I, you know, very often the dimension Mention, right, will be implicit from the content. So these two I's, they're actually different dimension matrices. One may be n by n, the other is n by m. But when we want to make the dimension of the matrix explicit, then sometimes we'll write to this I subscript n by n, kind of like we had up here. But very often, the dimension will be implicit.Finally, I just wanna point out that earlier I said that AB is not, in general, equal to BA. Right? For most matrices A and B, this is not true. But when B is the identity matrix, this does hold true, that A times the identity matrix does indeed equal to identity times A is just that you know this is not true for other matrices B in general.So, that's it for the properties of matrix multiplication and special matrices like the identity matrix I want to tell you about. In the next and final video on our linear algebra review, I'm going to quickly tell you about a couple of special matrix operations and after that everything you need to know about linear algebra for this class.
